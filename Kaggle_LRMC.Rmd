#找到$$S^H_x$$

$$logit(S^H_x) = ax+b$$
去除无关列

```{r}
RegularSeasonCompactResults <- RegularSeasonCompactResults %>% select(-Numot,-Daynum)
```


只使用有AH的数据就行回归

```{r}
RegularSeasonCompactResults <- RegularSeasonCompactResults[which(RegularSeasonCompactResults$Wloc == "A" |RegularSeasonCompactResults$Wloc == "H"),]
```


首先在常规赛上的数据建立分差列 (主场球队得分减去客场球队得分)
```{r}
RegularSeasonCompactResults <- RegularSeasonCompactResults %>%
  mutate(PointDiff = ifelse(Wloc == "H", Wscore - Lscore, Lscore - Wscore))
```

#建立S^H_x列

建立home和away的分列
```{r}
RegularSeasonCompactResults <- RegularSeasonCompactResults %>%
  mutate(home = ifelse(Wloc == "A", Lteam, Wteam),
         away = ifelse(Wloc == "A", Wteam, Lteam)
         )
```


建立下个客场是否胜利的分列

```{r, include=FALSE}
did_home_team_win_next_away_game = c()
for (i in seq(dim(RegularSeasonCompactResults)[1])) {
  
  #主场球队和客场球队的下一场比赛(客队的主场， 比赛中有一方是i的主队)
  #首先检查是否后续有比赛 (条件：i行的客场是这一行的主场， 并且输赢球队中有一个是i行的主场球队)
      if (is.na(RegularSeasonCompactResults[i+
         which(RegularSeasonCompactResults$home[-(1:i)] == RegularSeasonCompactResults$away[i] &
         (
         RegularSeasonCompactResults$Wteam[-(1:i)] == RegularSeasonCompactResults$home[i] |
         RegularSeasonCompactResults$Lteam[-(1:i)] == RegularSeasonCompactResults$home[i]
         ))
         ,][1,]$Wloc))
        
        {
         did_home_team_win_next_away_game = append(did_home_team_win_next_away_game,NA)
         }
      #如果不是na， 就是说有后面有比赛满足条件
      else{
        #如果返回的第一个值， 也就是最近的比赛
        #取最近客队主场的Wloc， 如果返回H,代表这次上次的客队在这次的主场取得了胜利
        #反之，则上次输的客队又输了， ith行记录 1
        if(RegularSeasonCompactResults[i+
         which(RegularSeasonCompactResults$home[-(1:i)] == RegularSeasonCompactResults$away[i] &
         (
         RegularSeasonCompactResults$Wteam[-(1:i)] == RegularSeasonCompactResults$home[i] |
         RegularSeasonCompactResults$Lteam[-(1:i)] == RegularSeasonCompactResults$home[i]
         ))
         ,][1,]$Wloc == "H") {
         did_home_team_win_next_away_game = append(did_home_team_win_next_away_game,0)
       }
        else {
        did_home_team_win_next_away_game = append(did_home_team_win_next_away_game,1)
      }
      }
  cat("processed " ,i ," iteration.", "\n")
    }
```

合并到regularseason里

```{r}

RegularSeasonCompactResults[,'did_home_team_win_next_away_game'] = did_home_team_win_next_away_game

```

去除na值
```{r}
RegularSeasonCompactResults <- RegularSeasonCompactResults[which(!is.na(RegularSeasonCompactResults$did_home_team_win_next_away_game)),]
```

看看图
主场球队的比分差距
```{r}
hist(x = RegularSeasonCompactResults$PointDiff,col = 'green', breaks = 500)
```

主场的平均分差与标准差

```{r}
meanDiff_home = mean(RegularSeasonCompactResults$PointDiff)
stdDiff_home = sd(RegularSeasonCompactResults$PointDiff)
```

分差与下一场赢的概率的关系

```{r}
min = min(RegularSeasonCompactResults$PointDiff)
max = max(max(RegularSeasonCompactResults$PointDiff))

prob = c()

for (i in seq(min,max)) {
  prob = append(prob,
                sum(RegularSeasonCompactResults[which(RegularSeasonCompactResults$PointDiff == i),]$did_home_team_win_next_away_game) / length(RegularSeasonCompactResults[which(RegularSeasonCompactResults$PointDiff == i),]$did_home_team_win_next_away_game))
}

plot(seq(min,max), prob)

```

使random forest回归来取得S^H_x的值

```{r}
logstic_model <- glm(did_home_team_win_next_away_game ~ PointDiff,
                     family = 'binomial', 
                     data = RegularSeasonCompactResults)

predict_data <- as.data.frame(seq(min,max),ncol = 1)

colnames(predict_data)[1] = "PointDiff"

prob_predict <- predict(logstic_model,predict_data,type = 'response')

plot(seq(min,max),prob_predict)
```

S^H_x+h 的50%值

```{r}
S_H_x = as.data.frame(prob_predict,row.names = as.character(round(seq(min,max))))

```

I got the 50% for home team is around 16.5 points

To estimate \tao, I use the equation 9 as in the imporved lrmc report.

```{r}
sigma_1 = 11
home_adv = 4
x = 16.5

f <- function(tao) (pnorm((((x/sigma_1)*(2*tao^2)/sqrt((sigma_1^2 +2*tao^2)*(sigma_1^2 +4*tao^2)))-(home_adv/sigma_1)*(sqrt((sigma_1^2+4*tao^2)/(sigma_1^2+2*tao^2)))))-0.5)

tao = uniroot(f, lower=0.1, upper=100000000)$root

```

I found Tao is 5.33, slightly great tha the report 4.26


```{r}
R_H_x = as.data.frame(prob_predict,row.names = as.character(round(seq(min,max) - meanDiff_home)))
```

#生成Pr(Z>0|X=x) 和 Pr (M>0 |X=x)

z table and m table

```{r}
#z table

z_table <- data.frame(seq(min,max))
m_table <- data.frame(seq(min,max))
colnames(z_table) = 'x'
colnames(m_table) = 'x'
z_table <- z_table %>% mutate(z_value = pnorm((2*tao^2/(sqrt((sigma_1^2+2*tao^2)*(sigma_1^2+4*tao^2))))*((x-home_adv)/sigma_1)))
m_table <- m_table %>% mutate(m_value = pnorm((sqrt(2*tao^2/(sigma_1^2+2*tao^2))*(x-home_adv)/sigma_1)))

```
